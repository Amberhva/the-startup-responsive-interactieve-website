                Regardless of their level, a football player's kit is about confidence as much as it's about performance. 
                From junior to professional, it's your amour from self-doubt. 
                A reminder that no matter where you are in the journey "from grassroots to greatness," you belong there. 
                And yet, this critical step in preparing the team's next season has been surprisingly traditional.

            <h5>Turning Athletes into Designers</h5>

            <p>
                The process began with one representative from the team meeting with a retailer armed with notes from players and management. 
                This customer then explains what they are looking for, pointing to samples that are not quite right while flipping through a pile of catalogs the retailer offers. 
                Hopefully, one of them is Nike.
